I have made a diabetes prediction app called DiabPred which predicts if the person has diabetes and gives resources for guidance as well as helping the person to find their nearest GP.

Main menu of my app:

The output if the person has diabetes:

If the user doesn't have diabetes, my app also checks if the person is at high risk or low risk for diabetes  and gives resources for guidance accordingly.

The output if the person is at high risk for diabetes:
